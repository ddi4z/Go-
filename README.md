# Go Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal Go (Golang) learning repository!  

This repository was born from my desire to **learn Go for backend development**, especially because I started getting interested in **cloud-native development**.  
To strengthen my skills, I decided to study Go while solving **Codeforces** and **LeetCode** problems, and taking notes on the languageâ€™s key concepts.
